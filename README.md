# Arvato_Customer_Segmentation


Overview

This project is about a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services, part of the Bertelsman Group.
Arvato provided 4 datasets which represents a sample of around 1 million people in the Federal Republic of Germany
in a Udacity project. Based on this data I tried to answer 2 main questions:

    1. What are specifics of a mail-order customer in Germany?
    2. Can I predict the response to a mailout campaign of a mail order company?

# Packages

For this jupyter notebook to run you need these common packages: Pyhton 3.6, jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
sklearn.

# Conclusion, Findings

2. Using supervised machine learning I could predict the outcome of the mailout campaign with a score of  0.71502 in this
